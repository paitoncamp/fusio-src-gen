# FusioSrcGenerator
Entity/Schema/Service & Action Generator is used to generate entity/schema/service & action classes for partial (specific) or all tables of existing database.

NOTE : As of now tested for only MySQL database. TO DO, need further enhancement for yaml resource generator.

based on https://github.com/channaveer/EntityGenerator
Happy Coding!
